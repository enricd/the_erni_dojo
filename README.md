# Welcome to: <br />👩‍💻🤖🎮👾 ___The_ ERNI _Dojo___ 👾🎮🤖👨‍💻

[![GitHub][github_badge]][github_link] 

This is a proposal project created by [Enric Domingo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/e-domingo/) (/[enricd](https://github.com/enricd)) for the [ERNI](betterask.erni)'s Promotions Program of 2022. Business Owner: Alberto Martín

The concept of this project is to be a platform where users compete by programming and submitting agents (code functions) that compete in an automatic and continuous way, updating a Leaderboard after every game which is played.

The current Prove of Concept is still under development and deployed for testing and evaluation. Many parts of the app could be incompleted, not properly working or containing bugs and failures. Please, report any bug or failure at:  
✉️ enric.domingo@betterask.erni

I'd love also to receive any kind of feedback from users, thanks!! 🤗
